AsciiDoxy let's you generate beautiful documentation using the combined power of AsciiDoc and 
Python. Write your documentation in [AsciiDoc 
format](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/)
and use [Python code](https://python.org) and [Mako Templates](https://makotemplates.org) to 
generate additional content. To top it all off, insert API documentation generated by 
[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl) to document your software.

For API documentation, the following languages are currently supported through Doxygen:

- C++
- Java
- Objective-C
- Python (using [doxypypy](https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy))
- Swift (transcoded from Objective-C only, native support expected in 0.9.x)
- Kotlin (transcoded from Java only, native support expected in 0.9.x)

Other features:

- Collect AsciiDoc files, images, API documentation and other resources from remote servers.
- Generate either a single HTML page or a multipage hierarchy.
- Transcoding: showing how to use elements written in one language in another compatible language.


## Get started now!

Before going public on GitHub, several people inside [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com) contributed to
the internal version of AsciiDoxy. Many thanks to:

- Andy Salter
- Arkadiusz Skalski
- Lukasz Glowcyk
- Nebojsa Mrmak
- Niels van der Schans
- Robert Gernert
- Tomasz Maj

The python package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and the
[audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage) project template.
