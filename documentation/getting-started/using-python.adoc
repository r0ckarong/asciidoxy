The most powerful feature of AsciiDoxy is that it allows you to use python code to generate (parts
of) your documentation. The python code can be written directly in the AsciiDoc files. AsciiDoxy
runs all python code and replaces it with valid AsciiDoc syntax before handing it over to
AsciiDoctor.

This feature enables most of the other functionality offered by AsciiDoxy. To fully use AsciiDoxy it
is important to understand how to include python code in you AsciiDoc files.

:sectnums:
== Basic syntax

AsciiDoxy uses https://www.makotemplates.org/[Mako templates] to combine python and AsciiDoc in a
single file. It supports all syntax supported by Mako.

The construct `${"${}"}` can be used to execute python code and insert the result in its place.
Everything between `${"${"}` and `}` is evaluated and executed as python code. The result of the
execution is inserted in the AsciiDoc file in the place of the `${"${}"}` construct.

For example:

[source]
----
${"""
The sum of 3 and 4 is ${3 + 4}.
"""}
----

Results in:

====
The sum of 3 and 4 is ${3 + 4}.
====

It is also possible to use built-in functions provided by python. For example:

[source]
----
${"""
The sum of 3 and 4 is ${sum([3, 4])}.
"""}
----

Also results in:

====
The sum of 3 and 4 is ${sum([3, 4])}.
====


[TIP]
====
For more information, and other options see:
https://docs.makotemplates.org/en/latest/syntax.html[Mako template syntax].
====

== Importing extra functionality

It is possible to use all functionality provided by
https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html[the python standard library]. Extra python packages
from https://pypi.org/[the python package index] can be used as well. Like in normal python scripts
the functionality does need to be imported before it can be used.

To import functionality, add an import statement within a so-called module-level block:

[source]
----
${"""
<%!
    import math
%>
"""}
----

Then use the imported functionality in any `${"${}"}` construct in the file:

[source]
----
${"""
The factorial of 5 is ${math.factorial(5)}.
"""}
----

This results in:

====
<%!
    import math
%>
The factorial of 5 is ${math.factorial(5)}.
====

== Custom functions

Module-level blocks can also be used to define custom functions to reuse in your AsciiDoc files.
Write the functions once in a module-level block, and use it multiple times in a `${"${}"}`
construct:

[source]
----
${"""
<%!
    def my_sum(*values):
        return sum(values)
%>

The sum of 3 and 4 is ${my_sum(3, 4)}.

The sum of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is ${my_sum(1, 2, 3, 4)}.
"""}
----

The result is:

====
<%!
    def my_sum(*values):
        return sum(values)
%>

The sum of 3 and 4 is ${my_sum(3, 4)}.

The sum of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is ${my_sum(1, 2, 3, 4)}.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Module-level blocks are executed once when the AsciiDoc files are loaded, before the content is
actually rendered. It is recommended to put all imports and user defined functions in module-level
blocks.

The AsciiDoxy built-in functionality is not available in module-level blocks. If you need to access
to that functionality, use a block without the `!`:

[source]
----
${"""
<%
    ...
%>
"""}
----

Regular python blocks are only executed when the surrounding text is rendered.
====

== Using variables

It is possible to define and use variables, like in normal Python code. Usually you define the
variables in Python blocks (`${"""<% ... %>"""}`). You can then use them in other Python blocks
and in expressions:

[source]
----
${"""
<%
    platform = "android"
%>

= Instructions for ${platform}

${include(f"instructions-{platform}.adoc")}
"""}
----

Variables defined in Python blocks are only available within the same AsciiDoc files. They are not
carried over to any of the included files.

== Sharing variables and functions

To share variables, and other objects like functions, with included AsciiDoc files, you can assign
them to the built-in environment called `env`. The environment will get copied to any document
included from the current document.

When changing variables, or assigning new variables, in an included document, the variables in its
parent will not change. The change is limited to the current document, and any document in
includes.

For example, you can set a variable in the entry point document:

[source]
.android.adoc
----
${"""
<%
    env.platform = "android"
%>

${include("instructions.adoc")}

"""}
----

Now you can use this variable in the included document:

[source]
.instructions.adoc
----
${"""
= Instructions for ${env.platform}

...
"""}
----

You can even share functions using the environment:

[source]
.main.adoc
----
${"""
<%!
    def my_sum(*values):
        return sum(values)
%>
<%
    env.my_sum = my_sum
%>

The sum of 3 and 4 is ${my_sum(3, 4)}.

${include("sub.adoc")}
"""}
----

[source]
.sub.adoc
----
${"""
The sum of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is ${env.my_sum(1, 2, 3, 4)}.
"""}
----

== Accessing command line arguments

All command line arguments provided to AsciiDoxy can be accessed in the AsciiDoc files through the 
`config` object. Arguments directly supported by AsciiDoxy are available by name. The dashes (`-`) 
are replaced by underscores (`_`). Arguments that have default values, will have these defaults 
applied. The other arguments that are passed through to AsciiDoctor are present unmodified in 
`config.extra`.

For example the build directory passed to Asciidoxy:

[source,bash]
----
asciidoxy --build-dir my-build-dir ...
----

Can be used inside AsciiDoc files:

[source]
----
${"""
${config.build_dir}
"""}
----
