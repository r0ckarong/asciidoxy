To get started with AsciiDoxy you need to install at least python and AsciiDoctor. The required
versions are specified in the ${cross_document_ref("../reference/requirements.adoc",
link_text="reference documentation")}.

:sectnums:
== Python

To install python see the https://www.python.org/[python website] and/or the documentation of your
operating system.

Most Linux distributions install python by default. Make sure the installed version matches the
${cross_document_ref("../reference/requirements.adoc", link_text="requirements")}.

On macOS python is also already installed, but this may be a version that is too old for AsciiDoxy.
You can use https://brew.sh[HomeBrew] to install a newer version of python.

== AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoctor runs on ruby. First install ruby for your operating system. See the
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[ruby documentation] for instructions.

Then use `gem` to install AsciiDoctor:

[source,bash]
----
gem install asciidoctor
----

To generate PDF files, you also need the PDF extension for AsciiDoctor:

[source,bash]
----
gem install asciidoctor-pdf
----

[NOTE]
====
Some Linux distributions support directly installing AsciiDoctor using its package manager. See the
documentation for your operating system, or
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#installing-the-asciidoctor-ruby-gem[AsciiDoctor].
====

== AsciiDoxy

Finally, install AsciiDoxy using `pip`:

[source,bash]
----
pip3 install --update asciidoxy
----

Now you are ready to go.
